This project is a C++ Student Management System designed to demonstrate practical use of core programming concepts such as vectors, structs, stacks, and file handling. It reads student records from a CSV file and provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the data. Users can view all students, search by ID or ZIP code, calculate averages, analyze course-wise performance, identify top or bottom scorers, generate a report card, and sort the student list.
